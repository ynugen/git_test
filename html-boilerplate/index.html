    <p>My first website!</p>

    <p>I am currently learning how to build a web page.</p>

    <!-- Headings have a hierarchy for importance -->
    
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h6>Heading 6</h6>
   
    <!-- Below we test with bold and italicised words -->

    <p>Some <strong>random</strong> text is what this is! You might be wondering why?</p>
    <p>Well, to be of some importance, you <em>must</em> be truly true.</p>

    <p>What if this is what I am wanting to talk about! <strong><em>Yes, this is what it is.</em></strong></p>

    <!-- Importance is important in HTML and <b> and <i> tags have aesthetic but have no importance -->
    
    <!-- Unordered lists -->
    <p>Below are some of my favourite foods:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apples</li>
        <li>Sushi</li>
        <li>Pho Ga</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Ordered List -->
    <p>What did I need to do today?</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush my teeth</li>
        <li>Wash my face</li>
        <li>Get out of my room</li>
    </ol>

    <p>One of the dreams I've always had is to travel around the world and experience human culture.
        There are places that I've been but there's always more to explore.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Netherlands</li>
        <li>France</li>
        <li>Hong Kong</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I've been really into movies lately. A literal slice of life, if not real they follow the same resonance as life.
        It is interesting seeing other people's interpretations of how we navigate the maze that is the human condition.
    </p>
    <p>My top favourite movies are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Whisper of the Heart</li>
        <li>Spirited Away</li>
        <li>Interstellar</li>
        <li>La La Land</li>
        <li>Stardust</li>
    </ol>
